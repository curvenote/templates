%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%
%  Title
%
% (A title should be specific, informative, and brief. Use
% abbreviations only if they are defined in the abstract. Titles that
% start with general keywords then specific terms are optimized in
% searches)
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Example: \title{This is a test title}

\title{[-doc.title-]}

%  AUTHORS AND AFFILIATIONS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Authors are individuals who have significantly contributed to the
% research and preparation of the article. Group authors are allowed, if
% each author in the group is separately identified in an appendix.)

% List authors by first name or initial followed by last name and
% separated by commas. Use \affil{} to number affiliations, and
% \thanks{} for author notes.
% Additional author notes should be indicated with \thanks{} (for
% example, for current addresses).

% Example: \authors{A. B. Author\affil{1}\thanks{Current address, Antartica}, B. C. Author\affil{2,3}, and D. E.
% Author\affil{3,4}\thanks{Also funded by Monsanto.}}

\authors{
[#- for author in doc.authors -#]
[-- author.name --]
[#- if author.affiliations -#]
\affil{
[-- author.affiliations|join(",", "index") --]
}
[#- endif -#]
[#- if not loop.last #], [# endif -#]
[#- endfor -#]
}

% \affiliation{1}{First Affiliation}
% \affiliation{2}{Second Affiliation}
% \affiliation{3}{Third Affiliation}
% \affiliation{4}{Fourth Affiliation}

[# for affiliation in doc.affiliations #]
\affiliation{[-affiliation.index-]}{[-affiliation.value-]}
[# endfor #]
%(repeat as many times as is necessary)

%% Corresponding Author:
% Corresponding author mailing address and e-mail address:

% (include name and email addresses of the corresponding author.  More
% than one corresponding author is allowed in this LaTeX file and for
% publication; but only one corresponding author is allowed in our
% editorial system.)

% Example: \correspondingauthor{First and Last Name}{email@address.edu}

[# for author in doc.authors #]
[# if author.corresponding #]
\correspondingauthor{[-author.name-]}{[-author.email-]}
[# endif #]
[# endfor #]

%% Keypoints, final entry on title page.

%  List up to three key points (at least one is required)
%  Key Points summarize the main points and conclusions of the article
%  Each must be 140 characters or fewer with no special characters or punctuation and must be complete sentences

% Example:
% \begin{keypoints}
% \item	List up to three key points (at least one is required)
% \item	Key Points summarize the main points and conclusions of the article
% \item	Each must be 140 characters or fewer with no special characters or punctuation and must be complete sentences

%  ABSTRACT and PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY
%
% A good Abstract will begin with a short description of the problem
% being addressed, briefly describe the new data or analyses, then
% briefly states the main conclusion(s) and how they are supported and
% uncertainties.

% The Plain Language Summary should be written for a broad audience,
% including journalists and the science-interested public, that will not have
% a background in your field.
%
% A Plain Language Summary is required in GRL, JGR: Planets, JGR: Biogeosciences,
% JGR: Oceans, G-Cubed, Reviews of Geophysics, and JAMES.

%Open Research
% AGU requires an Availability Statement for the underlying data needed to understand, evaluate, and build upon the reported research at the time of peer review and publication.

%Additionally, authors should include an Availability Statement for the software that has a significant impact on the research. Details and templates are in the Availability Statement section of the Data & Software for Authors Guidance:
% https://www.agu.org/Publish-with-AGU/Publish/Author-Resources/Data-and-Software-for-Authors#availability
