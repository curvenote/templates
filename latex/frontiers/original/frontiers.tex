%%% Leave the Abstract empty if your article does not require one, please see the Summary Table for full details.
\section{}
For full guidelines regarding your manuscript please refer to \href{http://www.frontiersin.org/about/AuthorGuidelines}{Author Guidelines}.

As a primary goal, the abstract should render the general significance and conceptual advance of the work clearly accessible to a broad readership. References should not be cited in the abstract. Leave the Abstract empty if your article does not require one, please see \href{http://www.frontiersin.org/about/AuthorGuidelines#SummaryTable}{Summary Table} for details according to article type.

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

For Original Research Articles \citep{conference}, Clinical Trial Articles \citep{article}, and Technology Reports \citep{patent}, the introduction should be succinct, with no subheadings \citep{book}. For Case Reports the Introduction should include symptoms at presentation \citep{chapter}, physical exams and lab results \citep{dataset}.



\section{Article types}

For requirements for a specific article type please refer to the Article Types on any Frontiers journal page. Please also refer to  \href{http://home.frontiersin.org/about/author-guidelines#Sections}{Author Guidelines} for further information on how to organize your manuscript in the required sections or their equivalents for your field

% For Original Research articles, please note that the Material and Methods section can be placed in any of the following ways: before Results, before Discussion or after Discussion.

\section{Manuscript Formatting}

\subsection{Heading Levels}

%There are 5 heading levels

\subsection{Level 2}
\subsubsection{Level 3}
\paragraph{Level 4}
\subparagraph{Level 5}

\subsection{Equations}
Equations should be inserted in editable format from the equation editor.

\begin{equation}
\sum x+ y =Z\label{eq:01}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Figures}
Frontiers requires figures to be submitted individually, in the same order as they are referred to in the manuscript. Figures will then be automatically embedded at the bottom of the submitted manuscript. Kindly ensure that each table and figure is mentioned in the text and in numerical order. Figures must be of sufficient resolution for publication \href{https://www.frontiersin.org/about/author-guidelines#ImageSizeRequirements}{see here for examples and minimum requirements}. Figures which are not according to the guidelines will cause substantial delay during the production process. Please see \href{https://www.frontiersin.org/about/author-guidelines#FigureRequirementsStyleGuidelines}{here} for full figure guidelines. Cite figures with subfigures as figure \ref{fig:2}B.


\subsubsection{Permission to Reuse and Copyright}
Figures, tables, and images will be published under a Creative Commons CC-BY licence and permission must be obtained for use of copyrighted material from other sources (including re-published/adapted/modified/partial figures and images from the internet). It is the responsibility of the authors to acquire the licenses, to follow any citation instructions requested by third-party rights holders, and cover any supplementary charges.

\subsection{Tables}
Tables should be inserted at the end of the manuscript. Please build your table directly in LaTeX.Tables provided as jpeg/tiff files will not be accepted. Please note that very large tables (covering several pages) cannot be included in the final PDF for reasons of space. These tables will be published as \href{http://home.frontiersin.org/about/author-guidelines#SupplementaryMaterial}{Supplementary Material} on the online article page at the time of acceptance. The author will be notified during the typesetting of the final article if this is the case. 

\section{Nomenclature}

\subsection{Resource Identification Initiative}
To take part in the Resource Identification Initiative, please use the corresponding catalog number and RRID in your current manuscript. For more information about the project and for steps on how to search for an RRID, please click \href{http://www.frontiersin.org/files/pdf/letter_to_author.pdf}{here}.

\subsection{Life Science Identifiers}
Life Science Identifiers (LSIDs) for ZOOBANK registered names or nomenclatural acts should be listed in the manuscript before the keywords. For more information on LSIDs please see \href{https://www.frontiersin.org/about/author-guidelines#Nomenclature}{Inclusion of Zoological Nomenclature} section of the guidelines.


\section{Additional Requirements}

For additional requirements for specific article types and further information please refer to \href{http://www.frontiersin.org/about/AuthorGuidelines#AdditionalRequirements}{Author Guidelines}.

\section*{Conflict of Interest Statement}

The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

\section*{Author Contributions}

The Author Contributions section is mandatory for all articles, including articles by sole authors.

The Author Contributions statement must describe the contributions of individual authors referred to by their initials and, in doing so, all authors agree to be accountable for the content of the work. Please see  \href{https://www.frontiersin.org/about/policies-and-publication-ethics#AuthorshipAuthorResponsibilities}{here} for full authorship criteria.

\section*{Funding}
Details of all funding sources should be provided, including grant numbers if applicable. Please ensure to add all necessary funding information, as after publication this is no longer possible.

\section*{Acknowledgments}
This is a short text to acknowledge the contributions of specific colleagues, institutions, or agencies that aided the efforts of the authors.

\section*{Supplemental Data}
 \href{http://home.frontiersin.org/about/author-guidelines#SupplementaryMaterial}{Supplementary Material} should be uploaded separately on submission, if there are Supplementary Figures, please include the caption in the same file as the figure. LaTeX Supplementary Material templates can be found in the Frontiers LaTeX folder.

\section*{Data Availability Statement}
The datasets [GENERATED/ANALYZED] for this study can be found in the [NAME OF REPOSITORY] [LINK].
% Please see the availability of data guidelines for more information, at https://www.frontiersin.org/about/author-guidelines#AvailabilityofData

\bibliographystyle{Frontiers-Harvard} %  Many Frontiers journals use the Harvard referencing system (Author-date), to find the style and resources for the journal you are submitting to: https://zendesk.frontiersin.org/hc/en-us/articles/360017860337-Frontiers-Reference-Styles-by-Journal. For Humanities and Social Sciences articles please include page numbers in the in-text citations 
%\bibliographystyle{Frontiers-Vancouver} % Many Frontiers journals use the numbered referencing system, to find the style and resources for the journal you are submitting to: https://zendesk.frontiersin.org/hc/en-us/articles/360017860337-Frontiers-Reference-Styles-by-Journal
\bibliography{test}

%%% Make sure to upload the bib file along with the tex file and PDF
%%% Please see the test.bib file for some examples of references

\section*{Figure captions}

%%% Please be aware that for original research articles we only permit a combined number of 15 figures and tables, one figure with multiple subfigures will count as only one figure.
%%% Use this if adding the figures directly in the mansucript, if so, please remember to also upload the files when submitting your article
%%% There is no need for adding the file termination, as long as you indicate where the file is saved. In the examples below the files (logo1.eps and logos.eps) are in the Frontiers LaTeX folder
%%% If using *.tif files convert them to .jpg or .png
%%%  NB logo1.eps is required in the path in order to correctly compile front page header %%%

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{logo1}% This is a *.eps file
\end{center}
\caption{ Enter the caption for your figure here.  Repeat as  necessary for each of your figures}\label{fig:1}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=15cm]{logos}
\end{center}
\caption{This is a figure with sub figures, \textbf{(A)} is one logo, \textbf{(B)} is a different logo.}\label{fig:2}
\end{figure}

%%% If you are submitting a figure with subfigures please combine these into one image file with part labels integrated.
%%% If you don't add the figures in the LaTeX files, please upload them when submitting the article.
%%% Frontiers will add the figures at the end of the provisional pdf automatically
%%% The use of LaTeX coding to draw Diagrams/Figures/Structures should be avoided. They should be external callouts including graphics.
